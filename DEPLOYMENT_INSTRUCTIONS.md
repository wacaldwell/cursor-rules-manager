## ðŸš€ **Quick Deployment to Work Machine**

### Option 1: Manual Setup (Recommended for first time)
1. **Copy the project** to your work machine's `/Volumes/para/resources/devops/projects/` directory
2. **Follow the guide**: Open `docs/WORK_MACHINE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` and follow every step
3. **Run setup script**: `./scripts/setup-new-machine.sh` (after reading the guide)

### Option 2: Automated Setup (For experienced users)
```bash
# On your work machine:
mkdir -p /Volumes/para/resources/devops/projects
cd /Volumes/para/resources/devops/projects
