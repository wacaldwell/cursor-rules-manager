# Cursor Rules Manager - Environment Setup Complete! 🎉

The Cursor Rules Manager has been successfully configured for your development environment and will automatically adapt to your workspace structure.

## ✅ What's Been Set Up

### Directory Structure
```
$WORK_DIR/                                      # Your workspace root (detected automatically)
├── projects/
│   └── cursor-rules-manager/                  # 📁 This management system
│       ├── .cursorrules                       # 📄 Source cursor rules
│       ├── templates/                         # 📋 Rule templates
│       ├── tools/                             # 🛠️ Deployment tools
│       └── docs/                              # 📚 Documentation
├── logs/cursor-rules-manager/                 # 📊 All deployment logs  
└── backups/cursor-rules-backup-*/             # 🔒 Automatic backups
```

**Environment Detection**: The system automatically detects your workspace by finding:
- `$WORK_DIR/global-parameters.env` (current standard)
- `$HOME/.devops-env` (user-specific)  
- Legacy configuration files (backward compatible)

### Core Features
- ✅ **Environment Agnostic**: Automatically adapts to any workspace structure
- ✅ **Git Flow Integration**: Uses proper feature/release branch workflow
- ✅ **Simple Deployment**: Easy script to update cursor rules across your workspace
- ✅ **Comprehensive Logging**: All activities logged to `$WORK_DIR/logs/`

## 🚀 How to Use

### Making Changes to Cursor Rules

1. **Edit the source templates**:
   ```bash
   cd $WORK_DIR/projects/cursor-rules-manager
   # Edit templates in templates/ directory
   ```

2. **Deploy changes**:
   ```bash
   ./tools/deploy-rules.sh
   ```

### Daily Workflow

```bash
# Navigate to the manager
cd $WORK_DIR/projects/cursor-rules-manager

# Create a feature branch for changes
git flow feature start update-rules

# Edit templates or configuration
# ... make your changes ...

# Deploy cursor rules changes
./tools/deploy-rules.sh

# Check deployment logs
tail -f $WORK_DIR/logs/cursor-rules-manager/deploy-rules.log

# Finish the feature when satisfied
git flow feature finish update-rules
```

## 🎯 What Your Cursor Rules Now Include

Your cursor rules now include:
- ✅ **MCP Server Consultation**: AWS and Terraform guidance requirements
- ✅ **DevOps Environment Logging**: All logs go to `$WORK_DIR/logs/`
- ✅ **AI Assistant Behavior**: Requires planning approval before execution
- ✅ **Security Standards**: No hardcoded credentials, least privilege access
- ✅ **Environment Configuration**: Uses global-parameters.env for workspace setup

## 🔧 Backup and Recovery

### If you need to restore from backup:

```bash
# Find your backup
ls $WORK_DIR/backups/cursor-rules-backup-*/

# Restore from backup (example - adjust paths as needed)
cp $WORK_DIR/backups/cursor-rules-backup-TIMESTAMP/workspace-cursorrules.backup \
   $WORK_DIR/.cursorrules
```

## 📊 System Integration

This system integrates perfectly with your existing devops environment structure:
- **Logs**: Uses your existing `$WORK_DIR/logs/` structure
- **Reports**: Compatible with `$WORK_DIR/reports/`
- **Backups**: Uses your existing `$WORK_DIR/backups/` 
- **Projects**: Works within your projects-based DevOps environment

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check logs: `tail $WORK_DIR/logs/cursor-rules-manager/deploy-rules.log`
2. Verify paths exist: `ls -la $WORK_DIR/projects/cursor-rules-manager/`
3. Check permissions: `chmod +x tools/deploy-rules.sh`
4. Verify environment: `echo $WORK_DIR` should show your workspace root

### If environment detection fails:
1. Ensure `global-parameters.env` exists in your workspace root
2. Check that `WORK_DIR` is properly set in your environment
3. Run the path configuration test: `./scripts/path-config.sh`

### If you need to start over:
```bash
# Restore from backup (adjust paths as needed)
cp $WORK_DIR/backups/cursor-rules-backup-*/workspace-cursorrules.backup \
   $WORK_DIR/.cursorrules
```
