# Cursor Rule Manager - Architecture Overview

## 🏗 **System Architecture**

The Cursor Rule Manager is built on a distributed architecture that separates rule definition, validation, and deployment into distinct, coordinated components.

## 🔧 **Core Components**

### 1. DevOps Rules Repository (`devops-rules`)
**Location**: `/Volumes/para/resources/devops/devops-rules/`
**Purpose**: Central rule definitions and automation

```
devops-rules/
├── environments/           # Environment-specific rules
│   ├── scripts/.cursorrules
│   ├── projects/.cursorrules
│   └── personal-scripts/.cursorrules
├── templates/              # Reusable rule templates
├── tools/                  # Automation scripts
├── global/                 # Global rule documents
└── .git/hooks/            # Git automation
```

**Key Features**:
- Git Flow branching strategy
- Automated validation via pre-commit hooks
- Automatic deployment via post-commit hooks
- Version tagging and semantic versioning

### 2. Working Directories
**Purpose**: Active `.cursorrules` files used by Cursor IDE

**Locations**:
- `/Volumes/para/resources/devops/scripts/.cursorrules`
- `/Volumes/para/resources/devops/projects/.cursorrules`
- `/Volumes/para/resources/devops/global-rules-for-coding.md`

**Characteristics**:
- Read-only (managed by automation)
- Automatically backed up before updates
- Synchronized from repository on releases

### 3. Automation Layer
**Components**:
- **Validation Script** (`validate-rules.sh`)
- **Sync Script** (`sync-rules.sh`)
- **Backup Script** (`backup-current-rules.sh`)
- **Git Hooks** (pre-commit, post-commit)

**Functions**:
- Rule consistency validation
- Automatic deployment
- Backup and recovery
- Branch-aware automation

### 4. Logging System
**Location**: `/Volumes/para/resources/devops/logs/`

**Structure**:
```
logs/
├── git-hooks/              # Git hook execution logs
├── sync-rules/             # Deployment logs
├── validate-rules/         # Validation logs
└── backup-rules/           # Backup operation logs
```

## 🔄 **Data Flow**

### Development Workflow
```
1. Developer starts feature branch
   ↓
2. Edits rules in repository
   ↓
3. Pre-commit hook validates changes
   ↓
4. Changes committed to feature branch
   ↓
5. Feature merged to develop branch
   ↓
6. Release created from develop
   ↓
7. Release merged to main branch
   ↓
8. Post-commit hook triggers deployment
   ↓
9. Rules synced to working directories
```

### Validation Pipeline
```
Rule Changes → Syntax Check → Section Validation → Consistency Check → Approval/Rejection
```

### Deployment Pipeline
```
Main Branch Commit → Backup Current Rules → Deploy New Rules → Verify Deployment → Log Results
```

## 🎯 **Design Principles**

### 1. Single Source of Truth
- All rule definitions centralized in Git repository
- Working directories are deployment targets, not sources
- Version control provides history and rollback capability

### 2. Automated Quality Assurance
- Pre-commit validation prevents invalid rules
- Required sections ensure completeness
- Consistency checks across environments

### 3. Safe Deployment
- Automatic backups before any changes
- Branch-aware deployment (only from main)
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

### 4. Developer Experience
- Git Flow provides structured workflow
- Clear separation between development and production
- Comprehensive documentation and quick reference

## 🔒 **Security Model**

### Access Control
- Repository access controlled via GitHub SSH keys
- Local file system permissions protect working directories
- Git hooks prevent unauthorized rule deployment

### Change Management
- All changes tracked in Git history
- Peer review possible via GitHub pull requests
- Release notes document all changes

### Backup and Recovery
- Automatic backups before rule changes
- Git history provides complete change tracking
- Manual recovery tools available

## 🚀 **Scalability Considerations**

### Multi-Environment Support
- Template system supports new environments
- Path configuration enables easy migration
- Environment-specific rule customization

### Team Collaboration
- Git Flow supports multiple developers
- Branching strategy prevents conflicts
- Merge conflict resolution tools available

### Maintenance
- Automated validation reduces manual effort
- Logging provides operational visibility
- Self-documenting through code and Git history

## 🔍 **Monitoring and Observability**

### Logging Strategy
- All operations logged with timestamps
- Structured log format for parsing
- Log rotation prevents disk space issues

### Health Checks
- Validation script provides system health status
- Git hook execution logged for troubleshooting
- Deployment verification ensures consistency

### Performance Metrics
- Sync operation timing
- Validation performance tracking
- Repository growth monitoring

## 🛠 **Technology Stack**

### Core Technologies
- **Git**: Version control and change management
- **Bash/Shell**: Automation scripting
- **Git Flow**: Branching workflow management
- **Python**: Complex rule processing scripts

### Dependencies
- Unix-like operating system (macOS/Linux)
- Git with Git Flow extensions
- SSH access to GitHub
- Standard Unix tools (sed, grep, find)

## 🔧 **Configuration Management**

### Path Configuration
All paths centralized in tool scripts:
- `RULES_REPO`: Repository location
- `DEVOPS_HOME`: Working directories root
- `LOG_DIR`: Logging destination

### Environment Variables
- Git configuration for user identity
- SSH configuration for GitHub access
- Shell configuration for script execution

## 📈 **Future Enhancements**

### Planned Features
- Web interface for rule management
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines
- Multi-repository support
- Advanced conflict resolution

### Scalability Roadmap
- Docker containerization
- Cloud deployment options
- Team collaboration features
- Advanced monitoring and alerting
