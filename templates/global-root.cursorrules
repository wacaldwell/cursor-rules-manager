# GLOBAL ROOT-SPECIFIC ADDITIONAL RULES
# =============================================================================

## WORKSPACE ORGANIZATION - CRITICAL
- **PRIMARY DIRECTORIES**:
  - `$WORK_DIR/projects/` - Structured development projects and applications
  - `$WORK_DIR/scripts/` - Development, experimental, and utility scripts

- **FILE ORGANIZATION**:
  - Use consistent directory structure within projects
  - Maintain separation between code, documentation, and data
  - Keep workspace root clean - use appropriate subdirectories

## GIT REPOSITORY MANAGEMENT
- **Multiple Repository Handling**: When working across different repositories in the workspace
- **Branch Awareness**: Be mindful of which repository and branch context you're operating in
- **Workspace-Level Changes**: Changes affecting multiple directories should be planned carefully

## CROSS-DIRECTORY OPERATIONS
- **Path Management**: Always use absolute paths when referencing files across directories
- **Dependency Tracking**: Document inter-directory dependencies clearly
- **Impact Assessment**: Consider workspace-wide impacts of changes

## BACKUP AND RECOVERY
- **Automated Backups**: Critical workspace data should have automated backup strategies
- **Recovery Procedures**: Document recovery procedures for workspace-level failures
- **Version Control**: Ensure important configurations are version controlled

## WORKSPACE MAINTENANCE
- **Regular Cleanup**: Implement strategies for managing workspace growth
- **Monitoring**: Track workspace health and resource usage
- **Documentation**: Maintain workspace-level documentation and inventories
