# Cursor Rules - Projects Additional Template
# Additional rules specific to structured development projects
# These rules are concatenated with base-global.cursorrules during deployment

# =============================================================================
# PROJECTS-SPECIFIC ADDITIONAL RULES
# =============================================================================

## PROJECT STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS - ENHANCED
- **MANDATORY PROJECT FILES**:
  - README.md with setup, usage, and deployment instructions
  - .gitignore appropriate to the project type and technology stack
  - requirements.txt (Python), package.json (Node.js), or equivalent dependency file
  - config/ directory for environment-specific configurations
  - tests/ directory for test files and test configurations
  - docs/ directory for comprehensive project documentation

## MANDATORY DOCUMENTATION FILES
All new projects and scripts must include the following documentation structure:
- **README.md**: Project overview, setup, usage, and deployment instructions (REQUIRED)
- **docs/project-overview.md**: Comprehensive project description including:
  - Purpose and goals
  - Architecture and design decisions
  - Key features and functionality
  - Technology stack and dependencies
  - System requirements and prerequisites
- **docs/ai-notes.md**: AI assistant interaction notes including:
  - Project context and background for AI assistants
  - Key decisions and reasoning
  - Common patterns and conventions used in the project
  - Known issues and workarounds
  - Tips for AI assistants working on this project
- **docs/dev-log.md**: Development log tracking (OPTIONAL but RECOMMENDED):
  - Chronological development history
  - Major milestones and releases
  - Problems encountered and solutions
  - Performance optimizations and refactorings
  - Future enhancement ideas

## WORK SESSION LOGGING (MANDATORY)
- Every time work is performed on a project (debugging, development, planning, maintenance, etc.), a session log entry must be created or updated in a file named `SESSION-NOTES.md` (or `DEBUG-SESSION-NOTES.md` if preferred) at the root of the project.
- Each entry must include:
  - Date/time
  - What was worked on
  - Status/findings
  - Next steps
- New entries go at the top (most recent first).
- This ensures continuity and rapid onboarding for all contributors.

## PROJECT LIFECYCLE MANAGEMENT
- **DEVELOPMENT PHASES**: Projects should follow structured development phases
- **VERSION CONTROL**: Use semantic versioning for project releases
- **DOCUMENTATION**: Maintain up-to-date documentation throughout development
- **TESTING**: Include comprehensive testing strategies and test coverage
- **DEPLOYMENT**: Document deployment procedures and environment requirements

## MULTI-PROJECT WORKSPACE AWARENESS
- **CROSS-PROJECT DEPENDENCIES**: Document and manage dependencies between projects
- **SHARED RESOURCES**: Use shared libraries and configurations appropriately
- **PROJECT ISOLATION**: Maintain clear boundaries between different projects
- **RESOURCE CONFLICTS**: Avoid port conflicts and resource contention between projects

## TECHNOLOGY-SPECIFIC ENHANCEMENTS
- **Python Projects**: Use virtual environments, type hints, and proper package structure
- **Node.js Projects**: Follow npm best practices, use appropriate package managers
- **Infrastructure Projects**: Use Infrastructure as Code principles
- **Web Applications**: Follow security best practices, responsive design principles

## COLLABORATION AND TEAMWORK
- **CODE REVIEWS**: All significant changes should go through code review process
- **BRANCH STRATEGY**: Use appropriate branching strategy for project complexity
- **COMMUNICATION**: Document decisions, architectural choices, and trade-offs
- **KNOWLEDGE SHARING**: Ensure project knowledge is accessible to all team members

## PRODUCTION READINESS
- **MONITORING**: Include logging, metrics, and monitoring capabilities
- **SCALABILITY**: Consider scalability requirements and constraints
- **SECURITY**: Implement security best practices throughout the project
- **MAINTENANCE**: Plan for ongoing maintenance and updates
